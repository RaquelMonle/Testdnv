We have two scenarios here:
	- Scenario one (Login with existent account) will be chosen to verify that normal path of the website is working correctly.
        This scenario will use by default the account raquelmonle@verified.com
        In case you would like to execute the test with other existent account should be defined in my steps.
    - Scenario two (Login with nonexistent account) will be chosen to verify that you cannot log in with an nonexistent account.
        This scenario will use by default the account raquelmonle@madeup.com
        In case you would like to execute the test with other account must also be specified.

For instance, if we don't specify anything, we will run the default configuration.

\\As you can actually see in 'my stepsdefs' it is not defined anything as I explained you in the email\\
